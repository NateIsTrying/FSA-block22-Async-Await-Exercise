# FSA-block22-Async-Await-Exercise
Part of Block22 Exercise. Used 'REST Countries' API to create a random country generator. 

Decent work, but incomplete.
Things to complete:
 - Add Time and Date of Place
 - Add Randomize button instead of Refreshing to change.
 - Add Commas or Millions to populations to make readability easier.
 - Coat of Arms in place of a lesser category
